Think about the interface being seperate to the API. Have the interface be
configurable in what it can be backed by. You set a base URL, or perhaps
several. And lists of things becomes just one back end.

Another back end could be maybe an MP3 collection. Or perhaps a filesystem. You
could have optional parts of the interface like all of the modification stuff
could dissapear.



Host the api at

http://api.listsofthings.com/

Not sure how to do pagination. Some ideas:

GET /v1/things?offset=100&limit=50
GET /v1/things?first=100&last=150
GET /v1/things?page=3&perpage=50

Not sure how to do descriptive urls. Names can change. Should I embed ids?
Would mean that I can lazily setup redirection to the actual url. Gives 'moved'
functionality cheaply. Though I guess now I've got a history type db... should
be easier to do.

GET /v1/things/moves-345678876
GET /v1/things/345678876/moves

Offer a way to limit fields

GET /v1/things/123?fields=name,children
GET /v1/things/123?fields=name,children,children.name,children.apiPath

Have links in responses. Use javascript style names for attributes.

{
  "name": "Movies",
  "children": [
    {
      "name": "Disney",
      "apiPath": "/v1/things/847",
      "uiPath": "/things/847"
    }
  ]
)

Maybe link to other pages from listings

{
  "things": [{...}, {...}, ...],
  "previousPage": "/things?page=1,
  "nextPage": "/things?page=3
}

Search is just a view of the collection. 'search' is more clear than 'q' and
perhaps 'query' as well.

GET /v1/things?search=bambi

On errors use propper response codes. Unless someone asks not to

GET /v1/things?suppress_response_codes=true

Setup OAUTH 2.0. But how about js requests from the website?
